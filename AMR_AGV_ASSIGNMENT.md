# The Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) and Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR)

- AGV stands for Automated Guided Vehicle, and is a mobile robot that transports items or goods from one area to another by following a predetermined path, which is often marked by magnetic tape or wires implanted in the floor. AGVs are often used to automate material handling jobs to boost efficiency in manufacturing, distribution, and warehousing operations.
- AMR stands for Autonomous Mobile Robot, which is a mobile robot that navigates its environment and performs duties using sensors and advanced software rather than pre-programmed paths or physical infrastructure. AMRs are versatile and agile, making them perfect for dynamic environments and tasks that demand regular routing or handling changes. They are utilised in many areas, such as manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and retail.

## AGV/AMR History

- Automation for material handling and transportation extends back to the early twentieth century. The earliest automated guided vehicles (AGVs) were created in the 1950s and were primarily employed in industrial settings like factories and warehouses. Advances in technology, such as the development of sensors and computer control systems, led to the development of increasingly sophisticated AGVs capable of navigating complicated settings and adapting to changing conditions in the 1980s.

- In recent years, there has been increased interest in autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), which are similar to AGVs but have improved sensors and navigation systems that allow them to travel freely throughout a facility without the need for predefined courses or markers. The rise of AMRs is inextricably tied to the advent of Industry 4.0, a movement towards more automation and digitization in manufacturing and other industries. AGVs and AMRs are now employed to improve efficiency and minimise labour costs in a range of environments, including manufacturing plants, warehouses, hospitals, and retail outlets.
