# The Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) and Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR)

-AGV stands for Automated Guided Vehicle, and is a mobile robot that transports items or goods from one area to another by following a predetermined path, which is often marked by magnetic tape or wires implanted in the floor. AGVs are often used to automate material handling jobs to boost efficiency in manufacturing, distribution, and warehousing operations.
-AMR stands for Autonomous Mobile Robot, which is a mobile robot that navigates its environment and performs duties using sensors and advanced software rather than pre-programmed paths or physical infrastructure. AMRs are versatile and agile, making them perfect for dynamic environments and tasks that demand regular routing or handling changes. They are utilised in many areas, such as manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and retail.
