# Swarm Robots

- Multiple robots wether homogeneous or heterogeneous are adapted to form a swarm of robots in swarm robotics. Because individual robots have processing, communication, and sensory capabilities on-board, they can communicate with one another and react to their surroundings autonomously.
- Individual robots in swarm robotics are often basic and have limited capabilities. When they work together, they can complete complex tasks and demonstrate cognitive behaviour. Swarm robots' collective behaviour derives from interactions between the robots and their surroundings, as well as interactions between the robots themselves.
- Swarm robotics offers a wide range of applications, including search and rescue, environmental monitoring, construction, agriculture, and transportation. Swarm robotics provides advantages such as resilience, flexibility, fault tolerance, and scalability by using the capabilities of several robots working together.
