# The Humanoid Robot

A humanoid robot is a robot that resembles the human body in shape and structure. These robots are designed to interact with human tools and environments, conduct experiments related to bipedal locomotion, and serve various other purposes. Typically, humanoid robots have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, although some may replicate only part of the body, such as the upper half. Some humanoid robots are also equipped with heads designed to replicate human facial features like eyes and mouths. Androids, on the other hand, are a specific type of humanoid robot that are built to aesthetically resemble humans
