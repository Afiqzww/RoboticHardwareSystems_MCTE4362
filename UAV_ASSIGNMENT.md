# The Unmanned Ariel Vehicle (UAV)

The UAV is an aircraft with autonomous or remote control. UAVs were initially created in the twentieth century to perform military tasks. By the twenty-first century, they had evolved into vital tools. As control technologies evolved, its functions has now expanded to numerous non-military applications as they became more affordable and effective. Aerial photography, precision farming, river monitoring, environmental monitoring, policing and surveillance, infrastructure inspections, product delivery, entertainment, and drone racing are some of these applications.

## UAV Composition
  
### Frame
Over the years multiple types UAV's have been developed for multiple various purposes and functions.
  
### Singlerotor
  
![single rotor drone](https://www.prodrone.com/wpdir/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PDH-GS120_002-1024x512.jpg)
  
Drones with a single rotor are robust and long-lasting. They resemble helicopters in terms of structure and design. A single-rotor aircraft has only one rotor, which is similar to one large spinning wing, and an additional tail rotor for direction and stability control.
  
### Multirotor

![quadcopter](https://www.mdpi.com/robotics/robotics-07-00065/article_deploy/html/images/robotics-07-00065-g014.png)  |  ![6 rotor drone](https://www.uavfordrone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87_20200821143644-removebg-preview.png)|
  
Multirotor UAVs have more than two rotors, each of which spins at a fixed pitch to produce lift. The drone can be made to ascend, hover, or descend by adjusting the rotor speed so that the thrust produced is greater than, equal to, or less than the forces of gravity and drag acting on the aircraft. The drone can also be made to turn or move horizontally by changing the speed of some of its rotors.
  
### Fixed wing

![fixed wing drone](https://uavos.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sit-run-1.jpg) 
  
Instead of using vertical lift rotors, a fixed-wing drone has one rigid wing that is created to look and function like an aeroplane. Therefore, this type of drone only requires energy to move forward and not to maintain its airborne position. They are energy-efficient as a result.

### Propulsion
  
|Type|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
|Electric|Efficient, Low emissions, Rechargable|Noisy, Shorter flight times, Limited payload capacity|
|Fuel|More power, Longer flight times|More Emissions|
|Solar|Unlimited flight times, No emissions|Limited payload capacity, Slower|
|Hybrid|Flexible power consumption, efficient|Expensive, Complex|	
  
### Navigation

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation is used to direct a UAV to the desired locations along an effective and collision-free path without the assistance of a person. It is essential for autonomous missions in challenging environments.

### Data Collection

The most common types of data collected by a UAV is

- Aerial imagery (RGB)
- Thermal imagery (IR)
- LiDAR data
- Atmospheric data
- Video
- location data
  
### Data Transmission
  
There are many forms of data transmission used for many different use cases:
  
|Type|Details|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Radio Frequency (RF)| Data is wirelessly transmitted using radio waves in RF communication. To send data to the ground control station or other receiving devices, UAVs frequently use this technique.|![RF transmission](https://pub.mdpi-res.com/sensors/sensors-21-01947/article_deploy/html/images/sensors-21-01947-g001-550.jpg?1615972544) |
|Satellite Communication (SATCOM)| When UAVs fly beyond line of sight (BLOS) or when the ground control station is far away, SATCOM is used. The UAV transmits information to an orbiting satellite, which relays it back to Earth. | ![satcom transmission](https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/92946a6ccd65cc4698f10d614c022d2787274d12/2-Figure1-1.png)|
