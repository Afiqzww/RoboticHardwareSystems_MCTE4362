# The Unmanned Ariel Vehicle (UAV)

The UAV is an aircraft with autonomous or remote control. UAVs were initially created in the twentieth century to perform military tasks deemed "dull, dirty, or dangerous" for humans. By the twenty-first century, they had evolved into vital tools for the majority of militaries. Control technologies' use expanded to numerous non-military applications as they became more affordable and effective. Aerial photography, precision farming, river monitoring, environmental monitoring, policing and surveillance, infrastructure inspections, product delivery, entertainment, and drone racing are some of these applications.
